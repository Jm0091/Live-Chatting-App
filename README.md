## 🔍 Application Description:
The **Live Chatting App** allows users to:
- Join chatrooms and engage in real-time conversations with other participants, providing a dynamic social experience.
- Benefit from an integrated database for user management and chat history, ensuring that all interactions are stored and accessible.
- Receive notifications for new messages, keeping users informed and engaged even when they're not actively in the chat.

### 🛠️ Key Technologies:
- **SignalR**: Utilized for implementing WebSocket connections, enabling real-time updates and interactions.
- **Model Classes**: Designed model classes to manage user data and chat messages effectively.
- **JavaScript & Bootstrap**: Employed for front-end styling and creating an intuitive user interface.

### 🧪 Testing Excellence:
- Developed a separate **MSTest** project to create and execute test cases, ensuring the reliability and stability of the application.
